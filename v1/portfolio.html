<h2>My life</h2>
<p>
Since I'm looking for a job right now, it's wise to have this portfolio/resume page. So, who am I?
</p>
<p>
My name is František Řezáč, I was born in 1983 in Czech Republic and I'm currently living in Prague.
I was interested in computers since childhood (apart from being an aircraft pilot, but that stopped with RC models).
My first Linux was Red Hat 5.2 (anyone remembers pre-enterprise Red hat era?) during 
<a href="http://www.gymvod.cz/">high school</a> studies. However I
hated math and all that exact science. Mainly because my father, Ivan, is an
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_sUqP-IiiA">actor</a>
(<a href="http://www.ceny-thalie.cz/historie.php">a good one</a>) and I grew up in a very "liberal" environment.
</p>
<p>
It changed when I was forced to pass final examination in Mathematics and Physics. I changed my mind and I
went to <a href="http://www.fav.zcu.cz/">University of West Bohemia</a> and graduated there with Master degree in Distributed Systems.
I also successfully passed all 4 semesters of <a href="http://cisco.netacad.net/">CCNA</a>.
</p>
<p>
With my grandfather being a chief of Institute of Modern Languages I learned English soon and traveled a lot during my whole life.
USA, Europe, India. You name it. I love nature and especialy mountains and that led me to hitchiking, mountaineering and
<a href="http://vno.cz/">mountain climbing</a>.
I also joined my good friend, Adam Wolf, who is leading a <a href="http://www.mawadani.cz/">group of children</a>
dedicated to woodcraft idea.
</p>
<p>
I was also working during my studies. I tried <a href="http://refresh.cz/">PHP company</a>,
<a href="http://www.ami.cz/cz/vitejte.html">Java company</a>, I was a freelancer. Apart from what is writen
in my CV, my recent non-commercial work can be seen at following places:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Web pages of my personal friend, cloathing designer <a href="http://www.ivasimandlova.cz/">Iva Šimandlová</a>. I created
PHP backend (from scratch) and coded graphic design into HTML. One of my first real works in web application industry.
</li>
<li>Web pages of <a href="http://www.vysehratky.cz/">Vyšehrátky</a> theatre festival. I created the content management system on top
of SilverStripe CMS.
</li>
<li>
Web pages of my <a href="http://vno.cz/">mountaineering club</a>.
This is a Drupal based web and I'm responsible for everything there.
</li>
<li>
My current "obsession" is <a href="http://calavera.info/weblib/">Weblib PHP framework</a>.
Since I released it under Apache license, everyone can review my coding skills there.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It's hard to describe my life in a few paragraphs:-).
