One of the downsides of unicode character set is that majority of fonts
doesn't contain glyphs for all unicode characters (because it's obviously
impossible) so you never know which character will be displayed correctly
and which won't.

This means that if someone uses some "special" character (for example 'âš“'), he
should check if it is
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1952649/is-it-safe-to-use-non-ascii-unicode-characters-like-in-web-sites/">correctly displayed</a>
on all target platforms (which
often means every existing platform).
</p>
<p>
This is generaly not possible. I tried to find some
"list of safe characters"
recently and I found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wgl4">WGL4</a>. I
think that there is enough propability that if it works on Windows,
it will work everywhere.
