# About this web
This is my personal web page. I have recreated it many times using many different Content Management Systems. One time I realized that the most important thing about any CMS technology is not how shiny and sophisticated the web is, but if the _data_ in it remains accessible even after the technology is deprecated. Since then I'm using only technologies and addressing scheme that allows me to keep my data online even after I move to another CMS. Since then I have produced 3 generations of such web presentations:

## v1
[First generation](/v1/index.html) was build on my home grown PHP app that generated the web from the static files dynamicaly on the server. When I moved away from PHP, the web is not very usable without the navigation and other generated part, but all the articles are still available on their original addresses.

## v2
[Second generation](/v2/index.xml) used client side XSL transformation directly in browser so it is completely static and fully usable even after I moved from my own server to GitHub hosting.

## v3
Third generation is the current one and it is based on the [Jekkyl](http://jekyllrb.com/) support on GitHub.

-------------------------------

# v0
I've decided to publish one more generation for archeological purposes. [Generation zero](/v0/index.html) is rather embarrassing because those were my first experiments with HTML. In 2000! Have fun! (Tip: the lights in the picture are links. Very cool, much mystery, wow)
